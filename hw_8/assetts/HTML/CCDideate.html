            <p>Decide which service your team of government employees needs to improve. Qualitative and/or quantitative evidence can help you here: leverage your 311 call center reports, web site analytics, and even social media to understand how services within your department could better serve your citizens. Set up conversations with folks within your department to understand their point of view and how they impact the service delivery.</p>

            <p>Use our matrix worksheet to keep track of the various service breakdowns that you uncover and decide which service to focus on.</p>

            <h3 class="underline">Step Two: Learn From Your Citizens</h3>
            <p>Now that you have decided on a service to improve, set up interviews with the stakeholders who are impacted by the service in order to obtain a deeper understanding of stakeholders’ pain points, goals, and needs. These stakeholders could be:
                <ui>
                    <li><strong>Service Customers</strong> pay for the service. Sometimes, service customers are the same as service users, but other times, they are not.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Users</strong> use the service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Backstage Employees</strong> work in the background of your service's agency and do not interact directly with end users of your service. </li>
                    <li><strong>Service Frontstage Employees</strong> work within your government service agency and interact directly with users of your service. </li>
                </ui>
                <p>Set up 45- to 60-minute individual interviews with at least 2-3 stakeholders from each of the above groups in order to get a full picture of how they interact with your service. (In a future version of this toolkit, we will walk you through some strategies for recruiting these stakeholders.) Ask open-ended, non-leading questions. So instead of asking “Do use public transportation to get around the city?”, which can lead to a simple “Yes” or “No” answer, or instead of asking “What is it like to ride the Port Authority bus?”, which assumes that your participant does ride the Port Authority bus, you could reformulate your questions to ask: “Can you tell me about the forms of transportation that you used to get around the city in the past week?” This question can lead to more specific and fruitful answers.</p>
                <p>Ask follow-up questions like, “Can you elaborate on that?” Have them get as specific as possible. Ask them to tell stories: “Can you tell me about the last time you did_____?” “Can you walk me through ______?” Through these interviews, you should be able to uncover needs, pain points, goals, opportunities, and meaningful stories that can help guide you to develop a solution that serves these stakeholders’ needs.</p>
                <p>So that you can focus on the participant, invite a colleague to accompany you to take notes. If none of your colleagues are available, you could bring along a recording device, but make sure to ask for the participant’s permission before starting the recording. </p>

            <p>Now that you have gathered a lot of information from your interviews, you can transfer your notes to a service blueprint that describes the current state of your service. A service blueprint is a tool that can help you to map out the various interactions between stakeholders across each touchpoint of your service. According to the design agency <a href="https://www.cooper.com/journal/2014/07/service-design-101">Cooper</a>, touchpoints are “the medium through which value exchanges happen, leading to the outcomes of a service. Touchpoints are these exchange moments in which service users engage with the service.”</p>
            <p>For each touchpoint on a blueprint, you can also map out the breakdowns, opportunities, and any technology used, as well as overall phases that encompass multiple touchpoints.</p>

            <p>Use our service blueprint template to start mapping out the current state of your service.</p>

            <h3 class="underline">Step Four: Ideate With Your Team</h3>
            <p>After completing your blueprint, take special note of the breakdowns.You can use these as opportunity areas to improve your service. With your team, set aside about two hours for ideation. The goal is to push your imagination to think of more creative and innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>For each breakdown, reframe it into a How Might We question, which will set the stage for ideation around the breakdown. To get the most out of your ideation, the How Might We question must be open-ended with some level of constraint, such as: <i>“How Might We help our 311 representatives better manage the influx of 311 requests while keeping it simple for citizens to report them?”</i> Have each of your team members generate multiple How Might Wes per service breakdown, and then vote on your favorite per service breakdown.</p>
            <p>Now it is time to ideate: Each person should fold a blank sheet of paper into eight squares. Time to play Crazy Eights: Set a repeating timer for one minute, and during each minute, sketch a different solution idea to solve for the service breakdown. At this point, don’t limit your ideas based on budget. The sky’s the limit, and you will have time to consider budget constraints later on as you hone in on solutions.</p>
            <p>Once the eight minutes is up, post all of your Crazy Eight sheets on a whiteboard and use one or two stickers to vote for your favorite. Repeat this process for each breakdown.</p>
            <p>Use our Crazy Eights worksheet with your team to start generating solution ideas.</p>

            <h3 class="underline">Step Five: Prototype a Solution</h3>
            <p>Now that you have landed on an idea, it is time to create it. Instead of putting all of your time and budget into developing your idea into a fully functioning solution, it is important to work on it incrementally through what is called a prototype so that you can quickly understand if your solution idea meets the needs of your citizens and if you need to make any changes before launching it.</p>
            <p>You can create multiple rounds of a prototype through various levels of what’s called fidelity, or degree of completion. Starting with simple materials like paper, foam core, cardboard or even acting can help you and your team to put together a cheap and effective composition of your solution to understand if and how it resonates with your stakeholders. This is called a low-fidelity prototype. (We will explain how you can evaluate your prototype with your stakeholders in Step Six.) If your solution idea involves an app or web site, you can use sheets of paper to draw the flow of your prototype would look on desktop and/or mobile. Once you evaluate your low-fidelity prototype, you can increase the fidelity of your prototype through technology (using HTML/CSS/Javascript) and design (using Balsamiq, Adobe Creative Cloud, Sketch, or other design software).</p>

            <h3 class="underline"> Step Six: Evaluate Your Solution</h3>
            <p>Now that you’ve developed your prototype, it is time to test it with stakeholders. While it will be important to get feedback from <a href="href=CCDideate.html#learn_link">Service Customers and Service Frontstage and Backstage Employees,</a> you can first focus on evaluating your prototype with Service Users, i.e., the people who will be using your service on a regular basis. Aim to evaluate your service prototype with 5 users.</p>
            <p>You can evaluate your prototype by conducting what is called a usability session, also known as a think aloud, with each of your Service Users.  Usability sessions are helpful to understand if your service is easy to use and allows you and your team to test certain assumptions you may have about how users interact with your service. You start by setting up the participant with a scenario  in which they would be interacting with your service and then ask them a task to see if they are able to complete a certain task while using your service prototype. You can repeat this for however many scenarios you want to test for your service.</p>
            <p>For example: Let's say that your team is improving how customers can report issues through 311. You are revamping the 311 web site as a result and want to see if the flow for reporting an issue on the web site makes sense to your participant. You might set them up in the following way duringthe usability session: "Imagine that you noticed that a stop light was out at the corner of Forbes and Craig. When you park your car, you pull out your phone to report the issue to 311. Please use this prototype to walk me through how you would go about reporting the issue, and think out loud as you go through the process."</p>
            <p>You can also incorporate questions to help you and your team understand if a service component is desirable to your users, such as, “What would prevent you from interacting with this service?” You will get more viable responses from your participants by focusing on follow-up questions that help you understand why your service is undesirable and avoiding questions that could lead to answers your participants may think you want to hear, like, “Would you use this service?”“ or “What do you like about this service?” Questions that focus on undesirability are more likely to invalidate your assumptions about your service.</p>
            <p>Just like with Step Two: Learn From Your Citizens, it will be important to have a colleague in the room to take notes during these usability sessions.</p>
            <p>Once you have run usability sessions with five participants, comb through your notes and find patterns: Where did people get stuck the most? Where did people get really excited? Take some time to reflect and brainstorm how you can make new changes and iterate on your prototype. Repeat Steps Five and Six until you are ready to launch your improved service.</p>
